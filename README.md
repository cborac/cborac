## 🧑‍💻 My Work

- Through 2020-2024, I've worked with several Gmod communities-highly Hogwarts role-play servers- where I developed necessary systems (closed-sourced) for them. I wrote these systems majorly in Lua [(Check out GLua API)](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/) and also included C++ and web server development. 
- I also have written Discord Bots for several communities (almost all of them are closed-source, but I recently published my framework publicly [Silica Framework](https://github.com/cborac/Silica-Framework))
- I also did random projects like [Runes++](https://github.com/cborac/Runes-plus-plus), [AirPods Connect](https://github.com/cborac/AirPods-Connect), which were primarily experimental and short-term projects, which I don't plan to continue development unless I am bored.
- I also have worked on several closed-source projects, which I cannot disclose here.
- I am also an iGEMer, I pariticpated few times with my high school!
  - **[🥈 Cellulophile (2021)](https://2021.igem.org/Team:Saint_Joseph)**: enchanced cellulases to fight against paper pollution.
  - **[🥈 Behcheck (2023)](https://2023.igem.wiki/saint-joseph/)**: a lateral flow assay to help detect Behçet's Disease.
